Create user1 and user2 on a Linux machine. They should not be added in any root level access groups.
  a) Create a directory test1 in the user1 home directory also create a file/s in it. The permissions should be set so user2 can modify the user1 file/s, create new ones but is unable to delete files owned by user1.
  
  ANSWER : 
  All should be done from user 1
user1@your-local-PC:/home/user1# mkdir -p /home/user1/test1
user1@your-local-PC:/home/user1# stat -c %a /home/user1/test1 775
user1@your-local-PC:/home/user1# touch /home/user1/test1/file1.txt /home/user1/test1/file2.txt /home/user1/test1/file3.txt
user1@your-local-PC:/home/user1# chmod o+w /home/user1/test1
user1@your-local-PC:/home/user1# stat -c %a /home/user1/test1 777
user1@your-local-PC:/home/user1# chmod +t /home/user1/test1
user1@your-local-PC:/home/user1# stat -c %a /home/user1/test1 1777
  
  
  b) Create a directory test2 in the user1 home directory. The permissions should be set so user2 can create modify files in it but all of the files in the directory that are created by user2 should be created under the user1 group
Points: 4

ANSWER : Execute from user1
user1@your-local-PC:/home/user1# mkdir -p /home/user1/test2
user1@your-local-PC:/home/user1# stat -c %a /home/user1/test2 775
user1@your-local-PC:/home/user1# chmod o+w /home/user1/test2
user1@your-local-PC:/home/user1# stat -c %a /home/user1/test 2777
user1@your-local-PC:/home/user1# chmod g+s /home/user1/test2
user1@your-local-PC:/home/user1# stat -c %a /home/user1/test2 2777
